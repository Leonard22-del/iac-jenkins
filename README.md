## 2 [Install Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu) with below commands. 

Downloads the GPG key required to verify the authenticity of Jenkins packages and saves it in the /usr/share/keyrings/ directory.

     sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

Add the Jenkins repository to your system's APT sources list and ensures that the repository is signed using the GPG key you downloaded

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]"  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins
